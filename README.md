# Gachaery Mart
150 tokens. Mom's grocery list. Can you get them all?

**This game was made as a 48 hr submission for the 2024 The Sheep's Meow Global Game Jam with the theme, Make Me Laugh.**

**Story:**

Welcome to the Gachaery Mart! 

Your mother has sent you to the store with 150 tokens to pick up groceries for the week. Choose the appropriate banner using the buttons on the left to roll for the groceries you need. Each roll uses one token. 

Good luck, and thank you for shopping at the Gachaery Mart!


**Controls:**

Choose your banner using the buttons on the left. Each banner has 5 special grocery items of varying rarities, ranging from 3 stars to 5 stars. Below are the rates for each rarity:

    3-Star: 75%
    4-Star: 20%
    5-Star: 5%

Aside from the advertised items, each banner includes a special 5-Star item: a 24-pack of toilet paper (two-ply, if you must know; we only offer the best to our customers).

Use the buttons on the bottom (ROLL 1, ROLL 5) to use either 1 or 5 tokens for the respective amount of rolls. 

But keep an eye on the token counter! Run out of tokens, and Mama won't be too happy with you.


**Note:** Sorry, we didn't have time to add a win state! Mommy's always gonna be disappointed with you, but we're proud of you.
